# iotplayground
Playground for me to learn different IoT stacks

This project is primarily for me to learn - the goal is to develop a cross-container/cross-platform app.  I don't expect it to be particularly useful - but to express some questions about IoT's state today.

Platforms:
- SmartThings
- AWS, AWS IoT
- Alexa
- Arduino
- Android
- [IBM Watson] - if I get to it for personalization, ML
- IFTTT - using the make channel and Node.js

Tech Choices:
- Groovy (for smartthings)
- Node.js
- nools (maybe not, aws has enough support for rules so I don't need to learn this)
- mqtt.js (for use with AWS IoT)

Capabilities:
- Rules engine to define 'complex' states to trigger actions
- Voice commands
- Data storage, and 'learning' to drive facts & assertions in rules
- Android app to interact
