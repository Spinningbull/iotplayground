# iotplayground
Playground for me to learn different IoT stacks

This project is primarily for me to learn - the goal is to develop a cross-container/cross-platform app.  I don't expect it to be particularly useful - but to express some questions about IoT's state today.

Platforms:
- SmartThings
- AWS
- Alexa
- Arduino
- Android
- [IBM Watson] - if I get to it for personalization, ML

Tech Choices:
- Groovy (for smartthings)
- Node.js
- nools

Capabilities:
- Rules engine
- Voice commands
- Data storage, and 'learning'
-
